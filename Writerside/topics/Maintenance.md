# Maintenance

## IntelliJ version updates

JetBrains typically releases three major updates for IntelliJ IDEA per year. Each major release usually new
features, performance improvements etc. Between the major releases JetBrains releases minor updates and
bugfixes regularly. On [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13634-a-courses), once the plugin is
published, JetBrains automatically runs the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier tool and shows compatibility results on the plugin
page. There will be warnings if the plugin is incompatible with specific versions. Usually the tool will provide some
instructions or guidelines on how to fix the violations.
